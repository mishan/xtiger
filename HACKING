This is a release of the sourcecode for my TI92
emulator called "Tiger". You will find lots of 
strange things in the files and not many comments. 
Parts of the Makefile is left from UAE, and so is 
the strange process of compiling the 68k emulation 
core. Just type "make" on your x86-based linux and 
it should build fine. Next you can check the end of
include/options.h for some options, and if you
want to port it you should propably check
include/sysdeps.h and include/sysconfig.h for
constants and stuff that was generated by autoconf
during the compilation of UAE.
If I have time I'll write a better description of
the source later, and maybe fix it up with some
more comments, but dont bet on it :)
